## DH Economic Assessment Module

This module uses two GIS layers to calculate the DH potential and its associated grid costs in the pre-feasibility phase. Input files are:

* Heat demand density raster file in 1ha resolution in EPSG:3035
* Heated gross floor area density raster file in 1ha resolution in EPSG:3035

The outputs are saved in a defined output folder and also in the form of an Excel table.
